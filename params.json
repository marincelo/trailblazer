{"name":"Trailblazer","tagline":"Trailblazer Workout Application for Ubuntu Phone","body":"### Welcome to Trailblazer\r\nRead on if you want to hear about my concept of how workout tracking application should look like and how it should work.\r\n\r\n### The concept\r\nYou will have the ability to record the workout, review workout details, see list of past workouts and to upload to another service.\r\nRecording of the workout will capture your locations on your route and you will be able to see a lot of information such as distance covered, time elapsed, climb, descent, calories burnt etc.\r\nStatistics page will show you your distance/duration over week/month/year.\r\nAt a later stage, Ubuntu integration should be implemented. Things like Fitness scope and home screen notification (distance today or duration today).\r\nApplication will be fully functional in 'offline' mode. If you want to save your workouts in cloud, provide your UbuntuOne credentials(or that can be pulled from phone) and you will be able to upload to U1. The plan is to support uploading to existing sites such as Strava or Endomondo, basically, any site that provides GPX upload.\r\n\r\n### Roadmap\r\nThe first thing that needs to be done is Canonical getting their shit together. The state of GPS in Ubuntu Phone is unknown. Official documentation is just a copy-paste of QT documentation.\r\nWhen Location service starts working, workout recording will need to be implemented. Just recording as many GPS points as possible through your workout.\r\nAfter that, it is fairly simple to analyze the data and show you distance, duration, calories etc.\r\nAfter that, the statistics page will be implemented with nice overview of your statistics.\r\nThen comes the U1 integration. The ability to sync your data to the cloud with your personal account. U1 has NoSQL DB so that will be used for storing data.\r\nUploading to Strava and Endomondo (and possibly RunKeeper) is the next step.\r\nThe final step is creating a web site where you can log in with your U1 account and have an overview of your data.\r\n\r\n### Privacy\r\nI have no intention of harvesting your data. Everything will be kept locally on your phone. If you want, you can sync to U1 and have Canonical decide what to do with your data.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
